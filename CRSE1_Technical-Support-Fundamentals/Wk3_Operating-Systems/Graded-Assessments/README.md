# Qwiklabs Introduction
For some of your graded assessments, you’ll use the Qwiklabs tool to complete the assigned activities. Qwiklabs is an online lab tool that creates simulated Windows and Linux OS environments. With this tool, you can complete the course activities without having to install extra software on your computer. 

Important details
Qwiklabs allows you to use both Linux and Windows operating systems as if they were installed on your local machine. When you access your Qwiklabs activities through Coursera you will be given the software and OS setup needed to complete the activity within the tool.

Make sure to always access labs directly through Coursera (not through the Qwiklabs catalog). If you do not access labs directly through Coursera, you will not receive a grade. 

Here are some things to be ready for when using Qwiklabs:

* Unless stated otherwise, you will have 60 minutes to complete each Qwiklabs assignment.

* You'll experience a delay as the labs load. Also expect delays when the Linux and Windows simulated environments boot up.

Each lab connects you to a new Qwiklabs simulated environment. Each time, temporary credentials are created for you to connect to the lab. These credentials expire at the end of the lab assignment.

* Click “Start Lab” to begin your assessment activity.

* Click “End Lab” to end the activity.

* The lab needs to run for at least 5 minutes for your activity’s score to be shared back to Coursera. If you click the "End Lab" button before 5 minutes pass, your score may be recorded incorrectly in Coursera.

* Your grade is calculated when the lab is complete. Be sure to click the "End Lab" button when you've finished the assignment. 

* After you end the lab, you won't be able to access your previous work.

If you receive an error message while completing a lab, please reach out to the Qwiklabs support team through the chat support option in the lab’s ‘help’ menu.
