Assignment: In this project, you’ll create a security infrastructure design document for a fictional organization. The security services and tools you describe in the document must be able to meet the needs of the organization. Your work will be evaluated according to how well you met the organization’s requirements.

About the organization: This fictional organization has a small, but growing employee base, with 50 employees in one small office. The company is an online retailer of the world’s finest artisanal, hand-crafted widgets. 
                        They’ve hired you on as a security consultant to help bring their operations into better shape.

Organization Requirements: As a security consultant, the company needs you to add security measures to the following systems:

• An external website permitting users to browse and purchase widgets

• An internal intranet website for employees to use
      
• Secure remote access for engineering employees.
      
• Reasonable, basic firewall rules
      
• Wireless coverage in the office
      
• Reasonably secure configurations for laptops

Since this is a retail company that will be handling customer payment data, the organization would like to be extra cautious about privacy. They don’t want customer information to fall into the hands of an attacker due to malware infections or lost devices.

Engineers will require access to internal websites, along with remote, command-line access to their workstations.

What you’ll do: You’ll create a security infrastructure design document for a fictional organization. Your plan needs to meet the organization’s requirements, and the following elements should be incorporated into your plan: 

    • Authentication System
    
    • External website security

    • Internal website security
      
    • Remote access solution
      
    • Firewall and basic rule recommendations
      
    • Wireless security
      
    • VLAN configuration recommendations
      
    • Laptop security configurations
      
    • Application policy recommendations
      
    • Security and privacy policy recommendations
      
    • Intrusion detection or prevention for systems containing customer data 

My Response:

1. Authentication system
One-Time Password generators will be used as a second factor in authentication, which will be managed centrally by an LDAP server.

2. External Website Security
Since the customer-facing website will be an e-commerce site allowing users to explore and buy items as well as create and log into accounts, it will be provided through HTTPS. Public access would be granted to this website.

3. Internal Website Security
The internal employee website, which requires authentication for access by workers, will also be delivered through HTTPS. Additionally, only authorized accounts and the company's internal network will be able to access it.

4. Remote access solution
A network-level VPN solution, such as OpenVPN, will be required since engineers need remote access to internal websites as well as remote command-line access to workstations. A reverse proxy is advised in addition to a VPN to facilitate access to internal websites. Both of these would depend on the previously described LDAP server for authentication and authorization.

5. Firewall and basic rule recommendations
There would be a need for a network-based firewall appliance. It would have rules allowing traffic for different services, starting with an impact deny rule and eventually opening ports only when necessary. Additionally, rules will be required to authorize traffic to the VPN server, reverse proxy server, and internal website.

6. 802.1X with EAP-TLS should be used for wireless security. Client certificates would be needed for this, which can also be used to authenticate other services like VPNs, reverse proxies, and internal website authentication. As the company expands, 802.1X is a better option than WPA2 since it is more secure and simpler to operate.
